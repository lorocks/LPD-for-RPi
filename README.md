# LPD-for-RPi

All three folders contian the testing code for each specific model

The final chosen inference method is ONNX
The script is located in the ONNX folder

# To use Inference in RPi, ML Activation
The 'serial_object_detection.py' script is to be used with an Arduino connected to the RPi

The 'final_object_detection.py' script is the ML Activation method to be used without the Arduino
